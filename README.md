## Understanding GitHub Pages Caching

### How GitHub Pages Serves Your Site

When you deploy to GitHub Pages, your static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) go through multiple layers of caching:

1. **GitHub's CDN (Content Delivery Network)**: GitHub Pages uses a global CDN (Fastly) to serve your site quickly worldwide. The CDN caches your files at edge locations near your users.

2. **Browser Cache**: Your browser stores copies of CSS and JavaScript files locally to avoid re-downloading them on every visit.

3. **Service Workers** (if configured): Can cache assets for offline access.

### Why You Might See Old Content

**Deployment Timeline:**
```
Your Push → GitHub Actions Build → GitHub Pages Deploy → CDN Propagation → Browser Cache
   (instant)     (1-2 minutes)         (instant)          (1-5 minutes)      (until cleared)
```

**Common Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Immediate After Deployment**
- You push code and immediately check the site
- GitHub Pages CDN may still be propagating the new files to edge servers
- **Result**: You see the old version for 1-5 minutes
- **Solution**: Wait 2-3 minutes, then hard refresh

**Scenario 2: Browser Cache**
- You visited the site before the latest deployment
- Your browser cached the old CSS/JS files with a long expiration time
- **Result**: You see old styles even though new files are deployed
- **Solution**: Hard refresh or clear site-specific cache

**Scenario 3: CDN Edge Cache**
- The CDN edge server nearest to you still has the old version
- Other users in different regions may already see the new version
- **Result**: Geographic differences in what version users see
- **Solution**: Wait for CDN propagation (usually < 5 minutes) or clear cache

**Scenario 4: DNS Propagation** (rare)
- When GitHub Pages settings change
- **Result**: Site might be inaccessible or show old content for up to 24 hours
- **Solution**: Wait for DNS propagation to complete

### For Administrators: Best Practices

**When Deploying Updates:**

1. **Deploy During Low-Traffic Times**: Make changes when fewer users are active to minimize impact of cache propagation

2. **Wait Before Testing**: After pushing to `main`, wait 2-3 minutes before testing to allow CDN propagation

3. **Test Systematically**:
   ```
   Step 1: Check GitHub Actions completed successfully
   Step 2: Wait 2 minutes
   Step 3: Open site in incognito mode (fresh cache)
   Step 4: If issues persist, clear site-specific cache
   Step 5: Test on multiple devices/browsers
   ```

4. **Monitor Deployment**:
   - GitHub Actions: Check build completed successfully
   - GitHub Pages: Settings → Pages → View deployment status
   - Verify the deployment timestamp matches your latest commit

5. **Communicate with Users**: After major updates, inform users they may need to clear cache or hard refresh

**Cache Headers in Next.js Static Export:**

Next.js adds cache headers to static assets:
- **HTML files**: No cache or short cache (immediate updates)
- **CSS/JS in `_next/static/`**: Long cache with fingerprinted filenames (hash in filename)
- **Why this matters**: When you update CSS, Next.js generates a NEW filename, so browsers should fetch it automatically. If they don't, it's usually a CDN or browser cache issue.

### Developer Workflow: Seeing Changes Immediately

**Quick Method (Desktop):**
1. Open DevTools: `F12`
2. Right-click refresh → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
3. This bypasses both browser and CDN cache

**Mobile Testing:**
1. Use browser DevTools device emulation on desktop (fastest)
2. Or: Connect phone to desktop for remote debugging
3. Or: Use site-specific cache clearing on mobile device

**Pro Tip for Active Development:**
- Keep DevTools open with "Disable cache" checked (Network tab)
- This ensures you always see the latest version during development
- Remember: End users won't have this enabled, so final testing should be with cache enabled

### Troubleshooting
If the site appears unstyled or shows desktop navigation on mobile:

**Important:** Incognito/private browsing mode does NOT fix responsive design issues. If you see desktop navigation on mobile even in incognito mode, the CSS file is not loading correctly from GitHub Pages.

#### Clear Cache for This Site Only

**Desktop - Chrome/Edge:**
1. Open DevTools: `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows) / `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac)
2. Right-click the refresh button → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
3. Or: Go to `chrome://settings/siteData` → Search for "ffcadmin.org" (or "freeforcharity.github.io" for backup URL) → Remove

**Desktop - Safari:**
1. `Cmd+Option+E` (Develop menu must be enabled in Preferences)
2. Or: Safari menu → Clear History → Select "the last hour" → Clear History

**Desktop - Firefox:**
1. `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows) / `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac)
2. Time range: "Last Hour" → Select only "Cache" → Clear Now

**iPhone/iPad - Safari:**
1. Settings → Safari → Advanced → Website Data
2. Search for "ffcadmin.org" (or "freeforcharity.github.io" for backup) → Swipe left → Delete
3. Or: Settings → Safari → Clear History and Website Data (clears all sites)

**Android - Chrome:**
1. Chrome menu (⋮) → Settings → Privacy and security → Site settings
2. Search for "ffcadmin.org" (or "freeforcharity.github.io" for backup) → Clear & reset
3. Or: Chrome menu → History → Clear browsing data → "Last hour" → Cached images and files

**Android - Samsung Internet:**
1. Menu → Settings → Privacy and security → Delete browsing data
2. Select "Last hour" → Check only "Cache" → Delete

### What to Expect During Deployments

**Normal Deployment Behavior:**

1. **Push to `main` branch**: GitHub Actions automatically triggers
2. **Build phase** (1-2 minutes): Next.js builds static site
3. **Deploy phase** (instant): Files uploaded to GitHub Pages
4. **CDN propagation** (1-5 minutes): New files distributed to edge servers worldwide
5. **User sees changes**: Depends on their cache state

**If You See Desktop Navigation on Mobile:**

This indicates the CSS file is not loading. Check these items in order:

1. **Verify deployment completed**:
   - Go to repository → Actions tab
   - Latest workflow should show green checkmark
   - Click workflow → "deploy" job should be successful

2. **Check GitHub Pages is active**:
   - Repository → Settings → Pages
   - Should show "Your site is live at https://ffcadmin.org"
   - Backup/testing URL: https://freeforcharity.github.io/ffcadmin.org/
   - Note the last deployment time

3. **Verify CSS file exists**:
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Network tab
   - Refresh page
   - Look for CSS file: `/_next/static/css/[hash].css`
   - Should return status `200 OK` not `404 Not Found`

4. **If CSS returns 404**:
   - Check that `.nojekyll` file exists in the `out/` directory (prevents Jekyll from ignoring `_next/`)
   - Verify custom domain configuration in GitHub Pages settings
   - Re-run GitHub Actions workflow

5. **If CSS returns 200 but styles don't apply**:
   - This is a cache issue - follow cache clearing instructions above

**Cache vs. CSS Not Loading:**

- **Cache issue**: Incognito mode works, old version visible in normal browsing
- **CSS not loading**: Even incognito shows unstyled HTML, Network tab shows 404 for CSS
- **CDN propagation**: Some users see new version, others see old (temporary, resolves in 5 min)
