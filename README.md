## Deployment Status

**Status:** ✅ **Live and Accessible**

| Environment        | URL                                            | Status                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Production**     | https://ffcadmin.org                           | ✅ Active (Custom Domain) |
| **Backup/Testing** | https://freeforcharity.github.io/ffcadmin.org/ | ✅ Available              |

The site is automatically deployed via GitHub Actions when changes are pushed to the `main` branch. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed deployment configuration and troubleshooting.

**Key Features:**

- ✅ Static site generation with Next.js 14
- ✅ Automatic deployment via GitHub Actions
- ✅ Global CDN delivery through GitHub Pages
- ✅ Custom domain with HTTPS
- ✅ Fully responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- ✅ Automated Lighthouse audits for performance and quality

## Lighthouse Performance Monitoring

**Status:** ✅ **Automated Audits Active**

This project uses [Lighthouse CI](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci) to automatically audit web performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO after each deployment.

**What Lighthouse Measures:**

- 🚀 **Performance**: Core Web Vitals, load times, and optimization metrics
- ♿ **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance and screen reader compatibility
- 🏆 **Best Practices**: Security, HTTPS, console errors, and modern standards
- 🔍 **SEO**: Meta tags, crawlability, and search engine optimization

**How It Works:**

1. After each successful deployment to `main`, Lighthouse CI automatically runs
2. Audits are performed on key pages (home, tech stack, documentation)
3. Each page is tested 3 times to ensure consistent results
4. Reports are uploaded as GitHub artifacts and stored for 30 days
5. Results use a "warn" mode - they inform but don't block deployments

**Viewing Reports:**

1. Go to [Actions tab](https://github.com/FreeForCharity/ffcadmin.org/actions)
2. Select the latest "Lighthouse CI" workflow run
3. Download the "lighthouse-results" artifact to view detailed HTML reports

**Configuration:**

- Configuration: `lighthouserc.json`
- Workflow: `.github/workflows/lighthouse.yml`
- Minimum score thresholds: 90% for all categories (warning only)

**Benefits:**

- Proactive performance monitoring
- Catch accessibility issues early
- Validate SEO improvements
- Track metrics over time
- No build failures - informational only

## Responsive Design

**Status:** ✅ **Fully Responsive**

The site is optimized for all device sizes:

- ✅ Mobile phones (< 768px): Hamburger menu navigation
- ✅ Tablets (768px - 1024px): Full navigation, 2-column layout
- ✅ Desktops (> 1024px): Full navigation, 3-column layout

## Understanding GitHub Pages Caching

### How GitHub Pages Serves Your Site

When you deploy to GitHub Pages, your static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) go through multiple layers of caching:

1. **GitHub's CDN (Content Delivery Network)**: GitHub Pages uses a global CDN (Fastly) to serve your site quickly worldwide. The CDN caches your files at edge locations near your users.

2. **Browser Cache**: Your browser stores copies of CSS and JavaScript files locally to avoid re-downloading them on every visit.

3. **Service Workers** (if configured): Can cache assets for offline access.

### Why You Might See Old Content

**Deployment Timeline:**

```
Your Push → GitHub Actions Build → GitHub Pages Deploy → CDN Propagation → Browser Cache
   (instant)     (1-2 minutes)         (instant)          (1-5 minutes)      (until cleared)
```

**Common Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Immediate After Deployment**

- You push code and immediately check the site
- GitHub Pages CDN may still be propagating the new files to edge servers
- **Result**: You see the old version for 1-5 minutes
- **Solution**: Wait 2-3 minutes, then hard refresh

**Scenario 2: Browser Cache**

- You visited the site before the latest deployment
- Your browser cached the old CSS/JS files with a long expiration time
- **Result**: You see old styles even though new files are deployed
- **Solution**: Hard refresh or clear site-specific cache

**Scenario 3: CDN Edge Cache**

- The CDN edge server nearest to you still has the old version
- Other users in different regions may already see the new version
- **Result**: Geographic differences in what version users see
- **Solution**: Wait for CDN propagation (usually < 5 minutes) or clear cache

**Scenario 4: DNS Propagation** (rare)

- When GitHub Pages settings change
- **Result**: Site might be inaccessible or show old content for up to 24 hours
- **Solution**: Wait for DNS propagation to complete

### For Administrators: Best Practices

**When Deploying Updates:**

1. **Deploy During Low-Traffic Times**: Make changes when fewer users are active to minimize impact of cache propagation

2. **Wait Before Testing**: After pushing to `main`, wait 2-3 minutes before testing to allow CDN propagation

3. **Test Systematically**:

   ```
   Step 1: Check GitHub Actions completed successfully
   Step 2: Wait 2 minutes
   Step 3: Open site in incognito mode (fresh cache)
   Step 4: If issues persist, clear site-specific cache
   Step 5: Test on multiple devices/browsers
   ```

4. **Monitor Deployment**:
   - GitHub Actions: Check build completed successfully
   - GitHub Pages: Settings → Pages → View deployment status
   - Verify the deployment timestamp matches your latest commit

5. **Communicate with Users**: After major updates, inform users they may need to clear cache or hard refresh

**Cache Headers in Next.js Static Export:**

Next.js adds cache headers to static assets:

- **HTML files**: No cache or short cache (immediate updates)
- **CSS/JS in `_next/static/`**: Long cache with fingerprinted filenames (hash in filename)
- **Why this matters**: When you update CSS, Next.js generates a NEW filename, so browsers should fetch it automatically. If they don't, it's usually a CDN or browser cache issue.

### Developer Workflow: Seeing Changes Immediately

**Quick Method (Desktop):**

1. Open DevTools: `F12`
2. Right-click refresh → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
3. This bypasses both browser and CDN cache

**Mobile Testing:**

1. Use browser DevTools device emulation on desktop (fastest)
2. Or: Connect phone to desktop for remote debugging
3. Or: Use site-specific cache clearing on mobile device

**Pro Tip for Active Development:**

- Keep DevTools open with "Disable cache" checked (Network tab)
- This ensures you always see the latest version during development
- Remember: End users won't have this enabled, so final testing should be with cache enabled

### Troubleshooting

If the site appears unstyled or shows desktop navigation on mobile:

**Important:** Incognito/private browsing mode does NOT fix responsive design issues. If you see desktop navigation on mobile even in incognito mode, the CSS file is not loading correctly from GitHub Pages.

#### Clear Cache for This Site Only

**Desktop - Chrome/Edge:**

1. Open DevTools: `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows) / `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac)
2. Right-click the refresh button → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
3. Or: Go to `chrome://settings/siteData` → Search for "ffcadmin.org" (or "freeforcharity.github.io" for backup URL) → Remove

**Desktop - Safari:**

1. `Cmd+Option+E` (Develop menu must be enabled in Preferences)
2. Or: Safari menu → Clear History → Select "the last hour" → Clear History

**Desktop - Firefox:**

1. `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows) / `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac)
2. Time range: "Last Hour" → Select only "Cache" → Clear Now

**iPhone/iPad - Safari:**

1. Settings → Safari → Advanced → Website Data
2. Search for "ffcadmin.org" (or "freeforcharity.github.io" for backup) → Swipe left → Delete
3. Or: Settings → Safari → Clear History and Website Data (clears all sites)

**Android - Chrome:**

1. Chrome menu (⋮) → Settings → Privacy and security → Site settings
2. Search for "ffcadmin.org" (or "freeforcharity.github.io" for backup) → Clear & reset
3. Or: Chrome menu → History → Clear browsing data → "Last hour" → Cached images and files

**Android - Samsung Internet:**

1. Menu → Settings → Privacy and security → Delete browsing data
2. Select "Last hour" → Check only "Cache" → Delete

See [RESPONSIVE_DESIGN.md](./RESPONSIVE_DESIGN.md) for detailed troubleshooting

### What to Expect During Deployments

**Normal Deployment Behavior:**

1. **Push to `main` branch**: GitHub Actions automatically triggers
2. **Build phase** (1-2 minutes): Next.js builds static site
3. **Deploy phase** (instant): Files uploaded to GitHub Pages
4. **CDN propagation** (1-5 minutes): New files distributed to edge servers worldwide
5. **User sees changes**: Depends on their cache state

**If You See Desktop Navigation on Mobile:**

This indicates the CSS file is not loading. Check these items in order:

1. **Verify deployment completed**:
   - Go to repository → Actions tab
   - Latest workflow should show green checkmark
   - Click workflow → "deploy" job should be successful

2. **Check GitHub Pages is active**:
   - Repository → Settings → Pages
   - Should show "Your site is live at https://ffcadmin.org"
   - Backup/testing URL: https://freeforcharity.github.io/ffcadmin.org/
   - Note the last deployment time

3. **Verify CSS file exists**:
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Network tab
   - Refresh page
   - Look for CSS file: `/_next/static/css/[hash].css`
   - Should return status `200 OK` not `404 Not Found`

4. **If CSS returns 404**:
   - Check that `.nojekyll` file exists in the `out/` directory (prevents Jekyll from ignoring `_next/`)
   - Verify custom domain configuration in GitHub Pages settings
   - Re-run GitHub Actions workflow

5. **If CSS returns 200 but styles don't apply**:
   - This is a cache issue - follow cache clearing instructions above

**Cache vs. CSS Not Loading:**

- **Cache issue**: Incognito mode works, old version visible in normal browsing
- **CSS not loading**: Even incognito shows unstyled HTML, Network tab shows 404 for CSS
- **CDN propagation**: Some users see new version, others see old (temporary, resolves in 5 min)

### Testing Results

For detailed responsive design testing results, see [RESPONSIVE_TESTING_RESULTS.md](./RESPONSIVE_TESTING_RESULTS.md)

## Analytics

This site uses **Google Tag Manager (GTM)** to manage analytics and tracking tools, including **Microsoft Clarity** for user behavior analytics to help improve the user experience.

### Google Tag Manager Setup

Google Tag Manager is configured with container ID **GTM-WMZH965Q** and is loaded on all pages via `app/layout.tsx`. GTM manages the following tools:

- **Microsoft Clarity**: User behavior analytics and session recordings
- Additional tracking tools can be configured within the GTM container

### Analytics Configuration

**Microsoft Clarity** and other analytics tools are managed entirely through Google Tag Manager:

1. **GTM Container**: `GTM-WMZH965Q` is hardcoded in `app/layout.tsx`
2. **Clarity Configuration**: Set up within GTM dashboard at [https://tagmanager.google.com/](https://tagmanager.google.com/)
3. **Consent Management**: The cookie consent banner (`app/components/CookieConsent.tsx`) pushes consent events to GTM's dataLayer:
   ```javascript
   window.dataLayer.push({
     event: 'consent_update',
     analytics_consent: 'granted', // or 'denied'
     marketing_consent: 'granted', // or 'denied'
   })
   ```
4. **GTM Triggers**: Configure tags in GTM to fire based on consent_update events

### Adding Microsoft Clarity to GTM

To configure Clarity in Google Tag Manager:

1. Sign up for Microsoft Clarity at [https://clarity.microsoft.com/](https://clarity.microsoft.com/)
2. Create a project and obtain your Clarity Project ID
3. In GTM, create a new Custom HTML tag with the Clarity tracking code
4. Set the tag to fire on consent_update events when analytics_consent = 'granted'
5. Publish the GTM container

**Privacy & Compliance:** This implementation is privacy-compliant and follows GDPR/CCPA requirements:

- All analytics tools load only after explicit user consent
- The cookie consent banner is displayed on first visit
- Users can customize their cookie preferences at any time
- Analytics cookies are deleted if consent is withdrawn
- Consent state is communicated to GTM via dataLayer events

## Testing

This project includes comprehensive tests for the CI/CD pipeline and build output.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test:coverage
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite covers:

- Build output validation (files and directory structure)
- GitHub Pages configuration (`.nojekyll`, Next.js config)
- SEO metadata (robots.txt, sitemap.xml)
- Static route generation (home page, tech stack page)
- Configuration validation (package.json, lock files)

For detailed test case documentation, see [TEST_CASES.md](./TEST_CASES.md).

## Development Workflow

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

# Start development server
pnpm run dev
```

### Making Changes: Step-by-Step

When developing locally, follow this order to match the CI/CD pipeline:

```bash
# 1. Make your code changes
# (edit files in your editor)

# 2. Format code (auto-fix formatting)
pnpm run format

# 3. Check linting (code quality)
pnpm run lint

# 4. Build the project (TypeScript compilation)
pnpm run build

# 5. Run tests (validate everything works)
pnpm test
```

### Why This Order Matters

The CI/CD pipeline runs these steps in the same order:

1. **Format First** - Prettier ensures consistent code style
2. **Lint Second** - ESLint checks code quality after formatting
3. **Build Third** - Catches TypeScript errors and build issues
4. **Test Last** - Validates the final build output

**Important:** Always run `format` before `lint` to avoid conflicts between Prettier and ESLint style rules.

### Common Commands

```bash
# Development
pnpm run dev              # Start dev server (localhost:3000)
pnpm run format           # Auto-format all files
pnpm run format:check     # Check if files are formatted (CI uses this)
pnpm run lint             # Run ESLint
pnpm run build            # Production build
pnpm test                 # Run test suite
pnpm test:watch           # Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:coverage        # Generate coverage report
```

### Before Committing

Run all checks to ensure CI will pass:

```bash
pnpm run format && pnpm run lint && pnpm run build && pnpm test
```

If all checks pass locally, they should pass in CI.

### CI/CD Pipeline

All pull requests automatically run:

- ✅ Format check (`pnpm run format:check`)
- ✅ Linter (`pnpm run lint`)
- ✅ Build validation (`pnpm run build`)
- ✅ Test suite (`pnpm test`)
- ✅ Security scanning (CodeQL)

See [.github/workflows/README.md](./.github/workflows/README.md) for detailed CI/CD documentation.
